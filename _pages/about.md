Hi there! :wave:

I am a Software Engineer at Google. I live in California. I completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of California San Diego. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur. I am from Hyderabad and yes, I like biryani!

I am interested in real world applications of machine learning in both language and vision. I thoroughly enjoyed working on my graduate level academic projects that were applications of deep learning in the field of vision, recommender systems and language. I am learning everyday the pain points of deploying and maintaining machine learning algorithms and data quality in a real world setting.

I am guilty of starting a lot of projects/courses/books and stopping many of them midway. I plan to share my thoughts and learnings from those humble experiences here. In other news, my favorite hobby is playing badminton and I also like to read. :)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
